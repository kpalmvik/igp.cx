#Intergalactic Pizza
Intergalactic Pizza, formerly available at http://www.igp.cx, was a school project created by Kristofer Gustafsson (info@krigu.se) and Magnus Engström (magnus@aoeu.info) in april 2000. It was a part of the database course at IT/Data at [Hulebäcksgymnasiet](http://www.hule.harryda.se)

The basic idea was to offer online pizza ordering, something that was not yet widely available at the time. To make the project more interesting, the website feature pizza ordering from any planet within the solar system. Users could either sign up to become a member of ClubIGP, a membership club that simplified the ordering process by saving delivery information, or order pizza by entering the delivery information.

Users frequently complained that no pizza was ever delivered, but the ordering process was much appreciated.

##Purpose
The purpose of the project was to show what was possible to build with the web technology at the time. Compatiblity was tested using Internet Explorer version 2, 3, 4, and 5, Netscape version 3 and 4.7, and the text based browser Lynx.

The project included creative use of new technology, such as a [VRML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrml) world to assist in selecting what planet the pizza should be delivered to. If a custom pizza was ordered, including any number of custom ingredients selected from a list, an image depicting the resulting pizza would be rendered and shown to the user.

##Technology stack
The website was running on a Linux box with Apache, PHP3 and PostgreSQL.
